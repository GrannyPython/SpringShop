Also exists second "application" based on JSF and EJB(project name EJB, Address:  https://github.com/GrannyPython/EJB). It can connect via REST protocol to main app. Also,  You can check SpringShop\src\main\java\org\ts\web\restController in main app. After that it generates report about stats of our application. For example TOP-10 products. I have runned it on Glassfish server and wildfly. I hope that my code will help you in your plans. Good luck!
